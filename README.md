# React States Debugging Challenge

Someone really wanted to show their patriotism by building a website for all the flags of US states and territories. Unfortunately, they didn't quite understand React when they built it and they're asking for your help to debug the application.

## Getting Started

Fork and clone this repository. Use `cd` to move into the main directory and run `npm install` or `yarn install` depending on your preference.

Look over the code before you begin. Try to understand intentions behind the code before you begin.

## Intended Functionality

When the page loads, you should see a header, a background image of the US flag, and listings of all the flags for US states and territories.

When a state or territory gets clicked, the flag URL in the App state gets replaced which causes the background flag to also be replaced.

## Tips and Tricks

Pay attention to the difference between class components functional components.

Read the error messages! React has great error messaging so take advantage of it.

Be sure to check your assumptions. Why might something be undefined in certain places?
