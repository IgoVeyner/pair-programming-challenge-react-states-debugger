# React States Debugging Challenge

Someone really wanted to show their patriotism by building a website for all the flags of US states and territories. Unfortunately, they didn't quite understand React when they built it and they're asking for your help to debug the application.

## Getting Started

Fork and clone this repository. Use `cd` to move into the main directory and run `npm install` or `yarn install` depending on your preference.

Look over the code before you begin. Try to understand intentions behind the code before you begin.

## Intended Functionality

When the page loads, you should see a header, a background image of the US flag, and a listing of all the flags for states and territories in a grid.

When a state or territory gets clicked, its flag replaces the background flag.

## Tips and Tricks

Pay attention to which component is a class component and which component is a functional component.

Read the error messages! React has great error messaging so take advantage of it!

Be sure to check your assumptions. Why might something be undefined in certain places?
